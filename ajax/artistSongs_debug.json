rainy skies and gales<br \/>\r\nAnd I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow<br \/>\r\nThough my heart is full of tears at this farewell<br \/> <br \/>\r\nFor you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly<br \/>\r\nMore dearly than the spoken word can tell<br \/>\r\nFor you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly<br \/>\r\nMore dearly than the spoken word can tell<br \/> <br \/>\r\nI've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing<br \/>\r\nAnd the taste of war I know so very well<br \/>\r\nEven now I see the foreign flag a-raising<br \/>\r\nTheir guns on fire as we sail into hell<br \/>\r\nI have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow<br \/>\r\nBut how bitter will be this last farewell<br \/> <br \/>\r\nFor you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly<br \/>\r\nMore dearly than the spoken word can tell<br \/>\r\nFor you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly<br \/>\r\nMore dearly than the spoken word can tell<br \/> <br \/>\r\nThough death and darkness gather all about me<br \/>\r\nAnd my ship be torn apart upon the seas<br \/>\r\nI shall smell again the fragrance of these islands<br \/>\r\nAnd the heaving waves that brought me once to thee<br \/>\r\nAnd should I return home safe again to England<br \/>\r\nI shall watch the English mist roll through the dale<br \/> <br \/>\r\nFor you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly<br \/>\r\nMore dearly than the spoken word
